Tabs2Text
=========

**Tabs2Text** is a Firefox extension (addon) to export all of your opened tabs, from a browser window or from all windows, to a CSV, JSON or Markdown file type. It includes the tabs' title, URL and last acessed information.

It was developed in a few days of COVID-19 quarantine to easily export all of my open tabs, and as a way to learn more about the Firefox API.

### Install

It can be installed directly from [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabs2text/) page, or downloading the source code available here. See [Debugging | Firefox Extension Workshop](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/) for information about debugging.
