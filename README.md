Tabs2Text
=========

**Tabs2Text** is a Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome extension (addon) to export all of your opened tabs, from a browser window or from all windows, to a CSV, HTML, JSON or Markdown file type. It includes the tabs' title and URL information. For Firefox, last access data is also included (Chrome doesn't support it).

It was developed in a few days of COVID-19 quarantine to easily export all of my open tabs, and as a way to learn more about the Firefox API.
